#+TITLE: Todo

* TODO Implement new strategy
 - Use a timeline structure of lists + length.
   Make opaque w/ three operations:
    - Add entry
    - Modify last entry
    - Zip timelines
 - Resolve values in one sweep.
   Can resolve or simplify; resolve doesn't include dice
   Make two similar data types for this; one with dice, one without.
   Put in own modules for namespacing.
